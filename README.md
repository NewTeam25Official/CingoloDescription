# About the competion
The land is too dangerous for humans to reach the victims. Your team has been given a difficult task. The
robot must be able to carry out a rescue mission in a fully autonomous mode with no human assistance.
The robot must be durable and intelligent enough to navigate treacherous terrain with hills, uneven
land, and rubble without getting stuck. When the robot reaches the victims, it has to gently and carefully
transport each one to the safe evacuation point where humans can take over the rescue. The robot
should exit the evacuation zone after a successful rescue to continue its mission throughout the disaster
scene until it leaves the site. Time and technical skills are essential! Come prepared to be the most
successful rescue team.
